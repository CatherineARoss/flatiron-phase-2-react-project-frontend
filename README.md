# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Installation
```javascript
$ git clone Frontend  https://github.com/CatherineARoss/flatiron-phase-2-react-project-frontend

cd flatiron-phase-2-react-project-frontend

$ git clone Backend https://github.com/CatherineARoss/json-server-template

cd json-server-template
```

## Usage
It is an app for users to view and browse listings for a storefront that is selling crochet & knit patterns along with finished items. There are 3 different routes at the top of the page users can click on to toggle between a Home page, About page, and a Cart page. 

From the Home page, users can click the "Add to Cart" button on the listings which will add them to the cart visible on the Cart page. There is also a form on the Home page that allows users to fill out a Custom Order request that they can also add to their cart.

In the future, I would add more features like a "delete" button in the cart so users can remove any items they no longer wish to purchase. And also make the "Check Out" button bring the user to a new page to take their payment and shipping information.
